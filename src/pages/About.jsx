          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in 2024, WebGames started as a simple idea: make great games accessible to everyone. 
            We noticed that while mobile app stores were flooded with games, the web gaming experience 
            was often overlooked. We set out to change that by creating a platform that showcases the 
            best of what web gaming has to offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, we continue to grow our collection and improve our platform, always with our users 
            at the center of everything we do.
